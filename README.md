# dependency_parser
An ongoing learning project of building a shift-reduce dependency parser.
Functions for reading conll file, converting conll format into left/right/shift tags (that are our target here).
Trying classic ML (e.g. Random Forest classifier) and deep learning the correct action (left/right/shift) at each step.
More to come! Predicting dependency labels is the next goal.
